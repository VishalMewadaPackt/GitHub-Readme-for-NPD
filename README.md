# Deep Learning with PyTorch
This course will show you how you can implement cutting-edge applications that use image classification and NLP using the PyTorch library. Students will build a complete understanding of neural network terminologies and the different architectures available.


## What you will learn
* Implemented tensor operations in PyTorch, accelerated by GPUs
* Build a feed-forward neural network
* Classified images by implementing a CNN architecture in PyTorch
* Understood transfer learning using ResNet for building an image classifier with a small dataset
* Build intelligent systems for text classification, language modeling using RNN, LSTM, and GRU
